	abstract = {Touchless interfaces allow users to view, control and manipulate digital content without physically touching an interface. They are being explored in a wide range of application scenarios from medical surgery to car dashboard controllers. One aspect of touchless interaction that has not been explored to date is the Sense of Agency (SoA). The SoA refers to the subjective experience of voluntary control over actions in the external world. In this paper, we investigated the SoA in touchless systems using the intentional binding paradigm. We first compare touchless systems with physical interactions and then augmented different types of haptic feedback to explore how different outcome modalities influence intentional binding. From our experiments, we demonstrated that an intentional binding effect is observed in both physical and touchless interactions with no statistical difference. Additionally, we found that haptic and auditory feedback help to increase SoA compared with visual feedback in touchless interfaces. We discuss these findings and identify design opportunities that take agency into consideration.},

abstract = {Any motor action is, by nature, potentially accompanied by human errors. In order to facilitate development of error-tailored Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) correction systems, we focused on internal, human-initiated errors, and investigated EEG correlates of user outcome successes and errors during a continuous 3D virtual tennis game against a computer player. We used a multisensory, 3D, highly immersive environment. Missing and repelling the tennis ball were considered, as 'error' (miss) and 'success' (repel). Unlike most previous studies, where the environment encouraged the participant to perform a mistake, here errors happened naturally, resulting from motor-perceptual-cognitive processes of incorrect estimation of the ball kinematics, and can be regarded as user internal, self-initiated errors. Results show distinct and well-defined Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), embedded in the ongoing EEG, that differ across conditions by waveforms, scalp signal distribution maps, source estimation results (sLORETA) and time-frequency patterns, establishing a series of typical features that allow valid discrimination between user internal outcome success and error. The significant delay in latency between positive peaks of error- and success-related ERPs, suggests a cross-talk between top-down and bottom-up processing, represented by an outcome recognition process, in the context of the game world. Success-related ERPs had a central scalp distribution, while error-related ERPs were centro-parietal. The unique characteristics and sharp differences between EEG correlates of error/success provide the crucial components for an improved BCI system. The features of the EEG waveform can be used to detect user action outcome, to be fed into the BCI correction system.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have started to explore the implementation of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as part of driving assistant systems. The current study presents an EEG-based BCI that decodes error-related brain activity. Such information can be used, e.g., to predict driver's intended turning direction before reaching road intersections.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: We executed experiments in a car simulator (N = 22) and a real car (N = 8). While subject was driving, a directional cue was shown before reaching an intersection, and we classified the presence or not of an error-related potentials from EEG to infer whether the cued direction coincided with the subject's intention. In this protocol, the directional cue can correspond to an estimation of the driving direction provided by a driving assistance system. We analyzed ERPs elicited during normal driving and evaluated the classification performance in both offline and online tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: An average classification accuracy of 0.698±0.065 was obtained in offline experiments in the car simulator, while tests in the real car yielded a performance of 0.682±0.059. The results were significantly higher than chance level for all cases. Online experiments led to equivalent performances in both simulated and real car driving experiments. These results support the feasibility of decoding these signals to help estimating whether the driver's intention coincides with the advice provided by the driving assistant in a real car.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: The study demonstrates a BCI system in real-world driving, extending the work from previous simulated studies. As far as we know, this is the first online study in real car decoding driver's error-related brain activity. Given the encouraging results, the paradigm could be further improved by using more sophisticated machine learning approaches and possibly be combined with applications in intelligent vehicles.},

abstract = {— Communication with a robot using brain activity from a human collaborator could provide a direct and fast feedback loop that is easy and natural for the human, thereby enabling a wide variety of intuitive interaction tasks. This paper explores the application of EEG-measured error-related potentials (ErrPs) to closed-loop robotic control. ErrP signals are particularly useful for robotics tasks because they are nat-urally occurring within the brain in response to an unexpected error. We decode ErrP signals from a human operator in real time to control a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot during a binary object selection task. We also show that utilizing a secondary interactive error-related potential signal generated during this closed-loop robot task can greatly improve classifi-cation performance, suggesting new ways in which robots can acquire human feedback. The design and implementation of the complete system is described, and results are presented for real-time closed-loop and open-loop experiments as well as offline analysis of both primary and secondary ErrP signals. These experiments are performed using general population subjects that have not been trained or screened. This work thereby demonstrates the potential for EEG-based feedback methods to facilitate seamless robotic control, and moves closer towards the goal of real-time intuitive interaction.},

@article{Padrao2016,
abstract = {How do we recognize ourselves as the agents of our actions? Do we use the same error detection mechanisms to monitor self-generated vs. externally imposed actions? Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we identified two different error-monitoring loops involved in providing a coherent sense of the agency of our actions. In the first ERP experiment, the participants were embodied in a virtual body (avatar) while performing an error-prone fast reaction time task. Crucially, in certain trials, participants were deceived regarding their own actions, i.e., the avatar movement did not match the participant's movement. Self-generated real errors and false (avatar) errors showed very different ERP signatures and with different processing latencies: while real errors showed a classical frontal-central error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), peaking 100 ms after error commission, false errors elicited a larger and delayed parietal negative component (at about 350-400 ms). The violation of the sense of agency elicited by false avatar errors showed a strong similarity to ERP signatures related to semantic or conceptual violations (N400 component). In a follow-up ERP control experiment, a subset of the same participants merely acted as observers of the avatar correct and error movements. This experimental situation did not elicit the N400 component associated with agency violation. Thus, the results show a clear neural dissociation between internal and external error-monitoring loops responsible for distinguishing our self-generated errors from those imposed externally, opening new avenues for the study of the mental processes underlying the integration of internal and sensory feedback information while being actors of our own actions.},

For this purpose, children (age 7-8), young adolescents (age 13-14) and adults (age 23-24) performed a Go/No-Go task and were compared on overt reaction time (RT) performance and on event-related potentials (ERPs), thought to reflect error detection (error-related negativity: ERN) and conscious evaluation (error positivity: Pe) of the error. RT on correct trials, variability of responding and percentage of errors decreased with age. The latencies of incorrect responses, compared to correct responses, were shorter in children and adolescents than in adults, indicative of developmental changes in impulsive response style. Groups did not differ in the ability to adjust response strategies after making an error (post-error slowing). The ERN amplitude increased with age, the Pe amplitude did not change with age. Possible explanations for the developmental changes in ERN are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

While invasive studies allow investigating heading computation in moving animals, established non-invasive analyses of human brain dynamics are restricted to stationary setups. To investigate the role of the RSC in heading computation of actively moving humans, we used a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach synchronizing electroencephalography with motion capture and virtual reality. Data from physically rotating participants were contrasted with rotations based only on visual flow. Varying rotation velocities were accompanied by pronounced beta synchronization during physical rotation. In addition, heading computation based only on visual flow replicated alpha desynchronization in the RSC, which was absent during physical rotation. These results suggest an involvement of the human RSC in heading computation based on vestibular input and implicate revisiting traditional findings of alpha desynchronization during spatial orientation in movement-restricted participants.},

We demonstrate the interaction at the example of an interactive videogame in which users steer an airplane through winds rendered using force feedback.

We distinguish between external factors, that is those wholly determined by the hardware and software technology employed to generate the environment, and subjective factors, that is how sensory inputs to the human participant are processed internally. The therapeutic technique known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is used as a basis for measuring such internal factors. NLP uses the idea of representation systems (visual, auditory and kinesthetic) and perceptual position (egocentric or exocentric) to code subjective experience. The paper also considers one external factor, that is how the virtual environment represents a participant-either as a complete body, or just an arrow cursor that responds to hand-movements. A case-control pilot experiment is described, where the controls have self-representation as an arrow cursor, and the experimental group subjects as a simple virtual body. Measurements of subjects' preferred representation systems and perceptual positions are obtained based on counts of types of predicates and references used in essays written after the experiment. These, together with the control variable (possession/absence of a virtual body) are used as explanatory variables in a regression analysis, with reported sense of presence as the dependent variable. Although tentative and exploratory in nature, the data analysis does suggest a relationship between reported sense of presence, preferred representation system, perceptual position, and an interaction effect between these and the virtual body factor.},

We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability;there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs;individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; andindividuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

It is hypothesized that the conscious sense of presence reflects these two components as spatial presence and involvement. This prediction was confirmed in two studies (N = 246 and N = 296) assessing self-reports of presence and immersion experiences. Additionally, judgments of “realness” were observed as a third presence component. A second-order factor analysis showed a distinction between presence, immersion, and interaction factors. Building on these results, a thirteen-item presence scale consisting of three independent components was developed and verified using confirmatory factor analyses across the two studies.},

	abstract = {Kinesthetic haptic devices can make us feel that we are touching or holding objects that are not actually there by applying a force directly onto a user's body. As a corollary of Newton's third law, these devices are typically attached to the ground or else they would not be able to apply a net force onto a user. Thus, kinesthetic haptic devices typically have small workspaces-the area in which they can be used-or are overly cumbersome and expensive. Consequently, they are incompatible with room-scale virtual reality, which allows users to move and walk within a room. The portable haptics interface overcomes this limitation because its wearable form factor means it's "grounded" directly to a user's back, making it portable. In other words, this device approximates the sensations of a kinesthetic haptic device while also being portable. The haptic device consists of a robotic arm that is mounted on a user's back, and its end-effector is attached to an HTC Vive controller, enabling use with virtual reality. A first example application uses the portable haptics interface to simulate the elasticity of a bow and arrow as a user pulls on the bowstring of a virtual bow. A second application renders haptic feedback for impacts by applying an impulse of in the appropriate direction when a user hits a tennis ball with a racket in virtual reality. In an evaluation, we asked users to shoot targets in virtual reality with and without haptic feedback. Our results suggest that haptic feedback increases spatial presence with a large effect size but does not affect involvement and experienced realism. Our results also suggest several improvements to the ergonomics of the system such as using thicker straps to better distribute the load. In summary, portable kinesthetic haptic devices such as the portable haptics interface provide room-scale virtual reality applications with the sense of touch without constraining users to a chair.},

The participants of this experiment have to move inside the environment, while receiving several stimuli to check if any improvement in presence or realism in that environment is reflected on the vest. This is done by comparing the experimental results with those similar scenarios, obtained without haptic feedback. These experiments are carried out by three groups of participants who are classified on the basis of their experience in haptics and virtual reality devices. Some differences among the groups have been found, which can be related to the levels of realism and synchronization of all the elements in the multimodal environment that fulfill the expectations and maximum satisfaction level. According to the participants in the experiment, two different levels of requirements are to be defined by the system to comply with the expectations of professional and conventional users.},

I assess the current state of the art, addressing the perennial questions of technology and applications. By 1994, one could honestly say that VR "almost works." Many workers at many centers could doe quite exciting demos.Nevertheless, the enabling technologies had limitations that seriously impeded building VR systems for any real work except entertainment and vehicle simulators. Some of the worst problems were end-to-end system latencies, low-resolution head-mounted displays, limited tracker range and accuracy, and costs. The technologies have made great strides. Today one can get satisfying VR experiences with commercial off-the-shelf equipment. Moreover, technical advances have been accompanied by dropping costs, so it is both technically and economically feasible to do significant application. VR really works. That is not to say that all the technological problems and limitations have been solved. VR technology today "barely works." Nevertheless, coming over the mountain pass from "almost works" to "barely works" is a major transition for the discipline.I have sought out applications that are now in daily productive use, in order to find out exactly what is real. Separating these from prototype systems and feasibility demos is not always easy. People doing daily production applications have been forthcoming about lessons learned and surprises encountered. As one would expect, the initial production applications are those offering high value over alternate approaches. These applications fall into a few classes. I estimate that there are about a hundred installations in daily productive use worldwide.},

In our second experiment, visual feedback was degraded and the combined approach resulted in better performance than the glove-only approach and in better ratings of slider interactions than both glove-only and passive-only approaches. A third experiment allowed subjective comparison of approaches and provided additional evidence that the combined approach provides the best experience.},

Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success.

One reason for this is that PEs tend to be associated with task errors, as well as changes in motor output and visual input, making them difficult to isolate. Here this issue is addressed using electroencephalography. A strategy (STR) condition, in which participants were instructed on how to counter a 45° visuomotor rotation, was compared to a condition in which participants had adapted to the rotation (POST). Both conditions were matched for task errors and movement kinematics, with the only difference being the presence of PEs in STR. Results revealed strong parietal modulations in current source density and low theta (2–4 Hz) power shortly after movement onset in STR vs. POST, followed by increased alpha/low beta (8–18 Hz) power during much of the post-movement period. Given recent evidence showing that feedforward and feedback information is respectively carried by theta and alpha/beta oscillations, the observed power modulations may reflect the bottom-up propagation of PEs and the top-down revision of predictions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Current mainstream EEG electrode setups permit efficient recordings, but are often bulky and uncomfortable for subjects. Here we introduce a novel type of EEG electrode, which is designed for an optimal wearing comfort. The electrode is referred to as C-electrode where "C" stands for comfort.
METHODS: The C-electrode does not require any holder/cap for fixation on the head nor does it use traditional pads/lining of disposable electrodes - thus, it does not disturb subjects. Fixation of the C-electrode on the scalp is based entirely on the adhesive interaction between the very light C-electrode/wire construction ({\textless}35 mg) and a droplet of EEG paste/gel. Moreover, because of its miniaturization, both C-electrode (diameter 2-3mm) and a wire (diameter approximately 50 microm) are minimally (or not at all) visible to an external observer. EEG recordings with standard and C-electrodes were performed during rest condition, self-paced movements and median nerve stimulation.
RESULTS: The quality of EEG recordings for all three types of experimental conditions was similar for standard and C-electrodes, i.e., for near-DC recordings (Bereitschaftspotential), standard rest EEG spectra (1-45 Hz) and very fast oscillations approximately 600 Hz (somatosensory evoked potentials). The tests showed also that once being placed on a subject's head, C-electrodes can be used for 9h without any loss in EEG recording quality. Furthermore, we showed that C-electrodes can be effectively utilized for Brain-Computer Interfacing. C-electrodes proved to posses a high stability of mechanical fixation (stayed attached with 2.5 g accelerations). Subjects also reported not having any tactile sensations associated with wearing of C-electrodes.
CONCLUSION: C-electrodes provide optimal wearing comfort without any loss in the quality of EEG recordings.
SIGNIFICANCE: We anticipate that C-electrodes can be used in a wide range of clinical, research and emerging neuro-technological environments.},

	abstract = {We tested the applicability and signal quality of a 16 channel dry electroencephalography (EEG) system in a laboratory environment and in a car under controlled, realistic conditions. The aim of our investigation was an estimation how well a passive Brain-Computer Interface (pBCI) can work in an autonomous driving scenario. The evaluation considered speed and accuracy of self-applicability by an untrained person, quality of recorded EEG data, shifts of electrode positions on the head after driving-related movements, usability, and complexity of the system as such and wearing comfort over time. An experiment was conducted inside and outside of a stationary vehicle with running engine, air-conditioning, and muted radio. Signal quality was sufficient for standard EEG analysis in the time and frequency domain as well as for the use in pBCIs. While the influence of vehicle-induced interferences to data quality was insignificant, driving-related movements led to strong shifts in electrode positions. In general, the EEG system used allowed for a fast self-applicability of cap and electrodes. The assessed usability of the system was still acceptable while the wearing comfort decreased strongly over time due to friction and pressure to the head. From these results we conclude that the evaluated system should provide the essential requirements for an application in an autonomous driving context. Nevertheless, further refinement is suggested to reduce shifts of the system due to body movements and increase the headset's usability and wearing comfort.},

In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive framework for decoding ERPs, elaborating on linear concepts, namely spatio-temporal patterns and filters as well as linear ERP classification. However, the bottleneck of these techniques is that they require an accurate covariance matrix estimation in high dimensional sensor spaces which is a highly intricate problem. As a remedy, we propose to use shrinkage estimators and show that appropriate regularization of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) by shrinkage yields excellent results for single-trial ERP classification that are far superior to classical LDA classification. Furthermore, we give practical hints on the interpretation of what classifiers learned from the data and demonstrate in particular that the trade-off between goodness-of-fit and model complexity in regularized LDA relates to a morphing between a difference pattern of ERPs and a spatial filter which cancels non task-related brain activity.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is practiced by neurologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and others interested in functional brain imaging. Whether for clinical or experimental purposes, all studies share a common purpose-to relate scalp potentials to the underlying neurophysiology. Electrical potentials on the scalp exhibit spatial and temporal patterns that depend on the nature and location of the sources and the way that currents and fields spread through tissue. Because these dynamic patterns are correlated with behavior and cognition, EEG provides a "window on the mind," correlating physiology and psychology. This classic and widely acclaimed text, originally published in 1981, filled the large gap between EEG and the physical sciences. It has now been brought completely up to date and will again serve as an invaluable resource for understanding the principles of electric fields in living tissue and for using hard science to study human consciousness and cognition. No comparable volume exists for it is no easy task to explain the problems of EEG in clear language, with mathematics presented mainly in appendices. Among the many topics covered by the Second Edition are micro and meso (intermediate scale) synaptic sources, electrode placement, choice of reference, volume conduction, power and coherence measures, projection of scalp potentials to dura surface, dynamic signatures of conscious experience, neural networks immersed in global fields of synaptic action, and physiological bases for brain source dynamics. The Second Edition is an invaluable resource for neurologists, neuroscientists (especially cognitive neuroscientists), biomedical engineers, and their students and trainees. It will also appeal to physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, psychiatrists, and industrial engineers interested in EEG.},

Weber's seminal work in this area was extended and elaborated upon by German philosopher and mathematician Fechner (1801–1878), who coined the term “psychophysics” to refer to this area of experimental psychology and, in 1860, published the first textbook on psychophysics, which laid out the basic goals of this emerging discipline and the scientific methods that were to be employed to advance knowledge in this area (Watson, 1973).},

	abstract = {High-frequency vibrations are an essential part of numerous manipulation tasks. A promising research area, in particular, are telemanipulation tasks where vibrations occurring in the remote environment are fed back through tactile displays. Three experiments concerning the perception of vibrations were conducted. The first experiment aims at determining whether vibrations are coded primarily by frequency, amplitude, or acceleration by human participants. Results show that primarily frequency and amplitude, but not acceleration of the vibrations were perceived. In the second experiment, participants’ just noticeable difference (JND) for frequency under different conditions was examined. The resulting JND of 18\% for frequencies showed dependence neither on the amplitude or acceleration, which were independently held constant, nor on the reference frequencies. Therefore, it is not necessary to adjust the subjective intensity for vibrations for each human operator when designing and using tactile displays. In the third experiment, the stimuli and the procedure of the second experiment were replicated using different configurations and a mere force-output device. The resulting JNDs were 21\% for vibrations of 100 Hz, and 17\% for vibrations of 150 Hz and above. Furthermore, there was no visual dominance over the haptic modality regarding the JND for frequencies.},

	volume = {78},
	issn = {0095-6562},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The ability to continuously and unobtrusively monitor levels of task engagement and mental workload in an operational environment could be useful in identifying more accurate and efficient methods for humans to interact with technology. This information could also be used to optimize the design of safer, more efficient work environments that increase motivation and productivity.
METHODS: The present study explored the feasibility of monitoring electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) indices of engagement and workload acquired unobtrusively and quantified during performance of cognitive tests. EEG was acquired from 80 healthy participants with a wireless sensor headset (F3-F4,C3-C4,Cz-POz,F3-Cz,Fz-C3,Fz-POz) during tasks including: multi-level forward/backward-digit-span, grid-recall, trails, mental-addition, 20-min 3-Choice Vigilance, and image-learning and memory tests. EEG metrics for engagement and workload were calculated for each 1 -s of EEG.
RESULTS: Across participants, engagement but not workload decreased over the 20-min vigilance test. Engagement and workload were significantly increased during the encoding period of verbal and image-learning and memory tests when compared with the recognition/ recall period. Workload but not engagement increased linearly as level of difficulty increased in forward and backward-digit-span, grid-recall, and mental-addition tests. EEG measures correlated with both subjective and objective performance metrics.
DISCUSSION: These data in combination with previous studies suggest that EEG engagement reflects information-gathering, visual processing, and allocation of attention. EEG workload increases with increasing working memory load and during problem solving, integration of information, analytical reasoning, and may be more reflective of executive functions. Inspection of EEG on a second-by-second timescale revealed associations between workload and engagement levels when aligned with specific task events providing preliminary evidence that second-by-second classifications reflect parameters of task performance.},

In contrast, we demonstrate effective, goal-oriented control of a computer system without any form of explicit communication from the human operator. Instead, the system generated the necessary input itself, based on real-time analysis of brain activity. Specific brain responses were evoked by violating the operators’ expectations to varying degrees. The evoked brain activity demonstrated detectable differences reflecting congruency with or deviations from the operators’ expectations. Real-time analysis of this activity was used to build a user model of those expectations, thus representing the optimal (expected) state as perceived by the operator. Based on this model, which was continuously updated, the computer automatically adapted itself to the expectations of its operator. Further analyses showed this evoked activity to originate from the medial prefrontal cortex and to exhibit a linear correspondence to the degree of expectation violation. These findings extend our understanding of human predictive coding and provide evidence that the information used to generate the user model is task-specific and reflects goal congruency. This paper demonstrates a form of interaction without any explicit input by the operator, enabling computer systems to become neuroadaptive, that is, to automatically adapt to specific aspects of their operator’s mindset. Neuroadaptive technology significantly widens the communication bottleneck and has the potential to fundamentally change the way we interact with technology.},

ABSTRACT={In Virtual Reality (VR) it is possible to induce illusions in which users report and behave as if they have entered into altered situations and identities. The effect can be robust enough for participants to respond “realistically”, meaning behaviors are altered as if subjects had been exposed to the scenarios in reality. The circumstances in which such VR illusions take place were first introduced in the 80’s. Since then, rigorous empirical evidence has explored a wide set of illusory experiences in VR. Here we compile this research and propose a neuroscientific model explaining the underlying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that enable illusions in VR. Furthermore, we describe the minimum instrumentation requirements to support illusory experiences in VR, and discuss the importance and shortcomings of the generic model.}

	abstract = {The empirical and theoretical development of the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) is reviewed by considering factors that contribute to its amplitude, latency, and general characteristics. The neuropsychological origins of the P3a and P3b subcomponents are detailed, and how target/standard discrimination difficulty modulates scalp topography is discussed. The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted. Neuroinhibition is suggested as an overarching theoretical mechanism for P300, which is elicited when stimulus detection engages memory operations.},

	abstract = {The N200 and the feedback error-related negativity (fERN) are two components of the event-related brain potential (ERP) that share similar scalp distributions, time courses, morphologies, and functional dependencies, which raises the question as to whether they are actually the same phenomenon. To investigate this issue, we recorded the ERP from participants engaged in two tasks that independently elicited the N200 and fERN. Our results indicate that they are, in fact, the same ERP component and further suggest that positive feedback elicits a positive-going deflection in the time range of the fERN. Taken together, these results indicate that negative feedback elicits a common N200 and that modulation of fERN amplitude results from the superposition on correct trials of a positive-going deflection that we term the feedback correct-related positivity.},

	abstract = {The ERN or Ne is a component of the event-related brain potential that occurs when human subjects make errors in reaction time tasks. It is observed in response-locked averages, time-locked to the execution of the incorrect response. Recent research has reported that this component is present on correct response trials, thereby challenging the idea that the component is speciﬁcally related to error-processing. In this paper, we argue that the ERN or Ne observed on correct trials can be attributed to one or both of two factors: either there is error-processing on correct trials, and/or the response-locked averages used to derive the ERN/Ne are contaminated by negative components evoked by the stimulus. For this reason, there is no reason to abandon theories that relate the ERN/Ne to error-processing. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
